Registration For {EventName} Has Been Cancelled
----
Hello {FirstName},


We did not hear back from you about how you wanted to pay for "{EventName}", so we assumed you are not coming and we've freed up your spot for someone else.

If you do want to attend you can re-register and pay online, or follow the payment instructions in the email you receive after registration. 

You can reply to this email if you have any questions.


Sincerely,

MakeICT Event Team
