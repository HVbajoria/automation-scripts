Incomplete Registration For {EventName}
----
Hello {FirstName},


It appears that you have an unpaid registration for "{EventName}" on {EventDate} at MakeICT.  

Due to the frequency of unpaid no-shows for our classes, we have decided to modify how we handle class payments.  Starting on {EnforcementDate}, all new registrations that are unpaid within {CancellationWindow} days of an event will be cancelled automatically.  Online payments are the easiest and fastest for us to process, but cash and check will still be accepted. 

Payment options
	1. Through PayPal at members.makeict.org/Sys/Profile/Finances
	2. Cash/Check in the dropbox at MakeICT.  If you use this method, please reply to this email and let us know so we can hold your spot.  It will take a few days to process the payment.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can send them in a reply to this email.  I'll make sure they reach the appropriate party.

Thank you for your interest in events at MakeICT!


Sincerely,

MakeICT Event Team
